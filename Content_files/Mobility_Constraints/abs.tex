Optimal transportation policies depend on demand elasticities that interact across modes and vary across the population, but understanding how and why these elasticities vary has been an empirical challenge. Using an experiment with Uber in Egypt, we randomly assign large price discounts for transport services over a 3 month period to examine: (1) the demand for ride-hailing services and (2) the demand for total mobility (km/week). A 50% discount more than quadruples Uber usage and induces an increase of nearly 42% in total mobility. These effects are stronger for women, who are less mobile at baseline and perceive public transit as unsafe. Female participants report large increases in experienced safety on recent trips, owing to substitution away from public buses.  Structural estimates of the demand for safety indicate that a policy that leaves no passenger feeling unsafe on Cairoâ€™s public transit system would yield $4.8 Billion PPP in annual benefits.  Technology-induced reductions in the price of ride-hailing services could also generate considerable consumer surplus ($1.74 Billion PPP) but would be accompanied by substantial increases in external costs ($1.1 Billion PPP) resulting from increases in private vehicle travel.
