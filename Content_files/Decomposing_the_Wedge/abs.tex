Evaluations of energy efficiency programs reveal that realized savings consistently fall short of projections. We decompose this "performance wedge" using data from the Illinois Home Weatherization Assistance Program (IHWAP) and a machine learning-based event study research design. We find that bias in engineering models can account for up to 41\% of the wedge, primarily from overestimated savings in wall insulation. Heterogeneity in workmanship can also account for a large fraction (43\%) of the wedge, while the rebound effect can explain only 6\%. We find substantial heterogeneity in energy-related benefits from IHWAP projects, suggesting opportunities for better targeting of investments.
