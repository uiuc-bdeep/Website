Housing discrimination is illegal. However, evidence from paired-tester experiments
raises concern about the systematic exclusion of minority households from healthy
neighborhoods. Using data from HUDâ€™s most recent Housing Discrimination Study
and micro-level data on neighborhood attributes in 28 US cities, we find that minorities
are steered towards neighborhoods with less economic opportunity and greater
exposures to crime and pollution. Holding preferences and income constant, discriminatory
steering alone can explain a disproportionate number of minority households
found in high poverty neighborhoods in the US, potentially contributing to
the income mobility gap and the higher exposure of African American mothers to
toxic pollutants.
