# BDEEP Website

Our website based on a built-in domain at [Squarespace.com](https://www.squarespace.com/) and a third-party domain at [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). It contains four pages: About(Group intro), Team(intro), Research, Contact. Website content including abstracts as well as key figures are crawling from [GitHub](https://www.github.com/uiuc-bdeep/Website/) and are updated automatically. Messages from Contact page will directly go to BDEEP group slack channel. Please visit [www.uiuc-bdeep.org](https://www.uiuc-bdeep.org/).

## Structure 
This repository includes two parts. One is [Code_files](https://github.com/uiuc-bdeep/Website/tree/master/Code_files) storing the HTML, CSS, JavaScript files that embeded in the website; the other is [Content_files](https://github.com/uiuc-bdeep/Website/tree/master/Content_files) keeping projects' content that show publicly.
